Introduction
In modern security systems, biometric authentication has gained popularity due to its accuracy and reliability. This project aims to develop an advanced Fingerprint to Face Detection App that integrates fingerprint authentication with face recognition for enhanced security. The application will allow users to authenticate their identity using their fingerprint and then validate it against their facial features using AI-based recognition.
